Welcome to my blog, which is hosted on Git Hub.

I recently joined Git Hub in hopes to:

* Establish a better online presense for myself as a software developer
* Get exposure to technologies I wouldn't otherwise encounter in my day to day work
* Learn about Git
* Hopefully contribute to some cool projects

Once I get up and running, I plan on writing about a range of topics that interest me. Mostly programming, music, things I've been up to on Git Hub, and life in general.

Until then, please bare with me while I get everything set up!
